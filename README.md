# React Product Listing Page with Infinite Scroll

This project is a simple React-based product listing page that fetches products from an API and displays them in a grid layout. The page also features infinite scrolling, allowing users to load more products as they scroll down.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products fetched from an API.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically loads more products as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Add to Cart**: Each product has an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **npm** (version 6.x or later) or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-product-listing.git
   cd react-product-listing
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev 
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Usage

Once the app is running, you'll see a list of products on the home page. As you scroll down, more products will be loaded automatically. You can add products to the cart using the "Add to Cart" button.
